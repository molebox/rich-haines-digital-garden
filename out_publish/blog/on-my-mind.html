FaunaDB
in the few half hours I have while my baby son sleeps during the day. He&#x27;s not
yet 1 year old but we have him on a sort of schedule, so I can get some work
done between 12:00 and 13:30 depending on the day. It just so happens that my
other two children come home from school at around 13:40 everyday so the gap to
work is tight to say the least.</p><p>I have an agreement with my wife that I can code in the evenings, not every
night as that would be too much, but every other or whatnot. Im currently on
parental leave, home with my baby boy for 6 months. This happened to come a good
time given the current crisis covering the world, and I am thankful that I get
to spent this time with him, watching him grow before my eyes and do and try new
things at every moment.</p><p>I love coding. If I wasn&#x27;t married with 3 children I would probably code 24/7.
That&#x27;s straight up. I started coding at 33 and have been doing it for just over
3 and a half years. I sometimes wish I had started earlier so that I would have
had more time to hone my skills as there is so much to learn, so much cool stuff
I want to do but with so little time in the day to do it.</p><p>I had an idea a while back about writing email with MDX, I then saw a tweet from
<a href="https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau">josh</a> about the same thing and decided to get on it and turn my notes into a
reality. I started out by exploring the MDX docs, then I went through SMTP
servers thinking about a serverless solution, checked out other solutions and
eventually realized that I lack the time to put into this endeavour.</p><p>By the way, how many times do you misspell a word in md/mdx and just google
it, copy paste it and leave that tab open for future words? Ive got mine open
right now with endeavour currently the word in question...</p><p>During this process I consulted <a href="https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/">Chris Biscardi</a>&#x27;s website for some knowledge
about all of the above. If you ever have an idea I highly recommend checking his
site out as he posts mad knowledge about a ton of subjects. Anyway, while I was
there I saw the word garden in his header, I knew instantly that it was a
reference to his digital garden but I realized I actually had no idea what that
actually meant, so I clicked it. My eye was instantly drawn to his very aptly
named &quot;What is a Digital Garden&quot;.</p><p>It was from here that I saw a link to <a href="https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden">Joel Hooks</a>&#x27; article about this exact
same thing. And I have to say that this has blown my mind wide open. I sat for a
bit, thinking about redoing my website to correspond to this new way of
thinking. I then realized that I was missing the point completely. Its not about
marketing yourself via your posts. I didn&#x27;t need to re-design my site to fit
this new narrative, I could just start writing!</p><p>I think writing from the heart is a beautiful thing, I haven&#x27;t thought this post
through so much, im just typing what comes to me as thoughts and it feels good!
That&#x27;s not to say that all my writing will be like this from now on. The whole
concept of a digital garden is that you do away with the rigid structure of
traditional blogs that are sorted by date and category (exactly like mine is
today), instead you write about about ideas, small pieces that can grow later
on.</p><p>Get it down then get it done!</p><p>Anyway, this is my first idea piece, its not much in way of ideas, and you
probably wont find it useful. But that&#x27;s ok, because it not just for you, its
for me.</p></span></div><style data-emotion-css="u7b0zg">.css-u7b0zg{-webkit-flex-direction:row;-ms-flex-direction:row;flex-direction:row;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;height:50px;padding-left:1.25rem;padding-right:1.25rem;padding-top:1rem;padding-bottom:1rem;-webkit-box-pack:space-evenly;-webkit-justify-content:space-evenly;-ms-flex-pack:space-evenly;justify-content:space-evenly;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;position:static;top:0;}@media screen and (min-width:30em){.css-u7b0zg{-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;}}@media screen and (min-width:30em){.css-u7b0zg{height:50vh;position:fixed;right:0;top:200px;}}</style><div class="css-u7b0zg"><style data-emotion-css="vfy0yn">.css-vfy0yn{padding-left:0.5rem;padding-right:0.5rem;margin-left:1rem;}</style><a class="chakra-link css-vfy0yn" href="/"><style data-emotion-css="q7ub3n">.css-q7ub3n{font-family:Gagalin-Regular;font-size:14px;border-bottom:solid 2px;border-color:#EB1E99;padding:0.5rem;}@media screen and (min-width:30em){.css-q7ub3n{-webkit-transform:rotate(90deg);-ms-transform:rotate(90deg);transform:rotate(90deg);font-size:1xl;}}.css-q7ub3n:hover,.css-q7ub3n[data-hover]{border-color:#F056B3;}</style><p class="chakra-text css-q7ub3n">The funky page</p></a><a class="chakra-link css-vfy0yn" href="/blogs/search"><p class="chakra-text css-q7ub3n">The Garden</p></a></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"mdxSource":{"compiledSource":"\"use strict\";\n\nfunction _extends() { _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i \u003c arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; }; return _extends.apply(this, arguments); }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutProperties(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded); var key, i; if (Object.getOwnPropertySymbols) { var sourceSymbolKeys = Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(source); for (i = 0; i \u003c sourceSymbolKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceSymbolKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) \u003e= 0) continue; if (!Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(source, key)) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } } return target; }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = {}; var sourceKeys = Object.keys(source); var key, i; for (i = 0; i \u003c sourceKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) \u003e= 0) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } return target; }\n\n/* @jsx mdx */\nvar layoutProps = {};\nvar MDXLayout = \"wrapper\";\n\nfunction MDXContent(_ref) {\n  var components = _ref.components,\n      props = _objectWithoutProperties(_ref, [\"components\"]);\n\n  return mdx(MDXLayout, _extends({}, layoutProps, props, {\n    components: components,\n    mdxType: \"MDXLayout\"\n  }), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I've spent the last few days trying to get some work done on a piece for FaunaDB\\nin the few half hours I have while my baby son sleeps during the day.
