To walk away thinking that the only purpose of\nJamstack sites are to serve static files would be doing it a great injustice and miss some of the awesome things this\n&quot;new&quot; way of building web apps provides.</p><p>A few of the benefits of going Jamstack</p><style data-emotion-css=\"2yqebn\">.css-2yqebn{list-style-type:bullet;margin-left:1em;margin-top:2px;margin-bottom:2px;}</style><ul role=\"list\" class=\"css-2yqebn\"><li class=\"css-0\">High security and more secure. Fewer points of attack due to static files and external APIs served over CDN</li><li class=\"css-0\">Cheaper hosting and easier scalability with serverless functions</li><li class=\"css-0\">Fast! Pre-built assets served from a CDN instead of a server</li></ul><p>A popular way of storing the data your site requires, apart from as markdown files, is the use of a headless CMS\n(Content Management System). These CMSs have adopted the term headless as they don&#x27;t come with their own frontend that\ndisplays the data stored, like Wordpress for example. Instead they are headless, they have no frontend.</p><p>A headless CMS can be set up so that once a change to the data is made in the CMS a new build is triggered via a webhook\n(just one way of doing it, you could trigger rebuilds other ways) and the site will be deployed again with the new data.</p><p>As an example we could have some images stored in our CMS that are pulled into our site via a graphql query and shown on\nour site. If we wanted to change one of our images we could do so via our CMS which would then trigger a new build on\npublish and the new image would then be visible on our site.</p><p>There are many great options to choose from when considering which CMS to use:</p><style data-emotion-css=\"2yqebn\">.css-2yqebn{list-style-type:bullet;margin-left:1em;margin-top:2px;margin-bottom:2px;}</style><ul role=\"list\" class=\"css-2yqebn\"><li class=\"css-0\">Netlify CMS</li><li class=\"css-0\">Contenful</li><li class=\"css-0\">Sanity.io</li><li class=\"css-0\">Tina CMS</li><li class=\"css-0\">Butter CMS</li></ul><p>The potential list is so long i will point you in the direction of a great site that lists most of them\n<a href=\"https://headlesscms.org/\">headlesscms.org</a>!</p><p>For more information and a great overview of what the Jamstack is and some more of its benefits i recommend checking out\n<a href=\"https://jamstack.org/\">jamstack.org</a>.</p><p>Just because our site is served as static assets, that doesn&#x27;t mean we cant work in a dynamic way and have the benefits\nof dynamic data! We wont be diving deep into all of its benefits, but we will be looking at how we can take our static\nsite and make it dynamic by way of taking a serverless approach to handling our data through AWS Lambda functions, which\nwe will use via Netlify and FaunaDB.</p><style data-emotion-css=\"15salui\">.css-15salui{font-size:1xl;font-family:heading;margin-top:3px;margin-bottom:3px;}</style><p class=\"chakra-text css-15salui\">Serverless</p><p>Back in the old days, long long ago before we spread our stack with jam, we had a website that was a combination of HTML\nmarkup, CSS styling and JavaScript. Our website gave our user data to access and manipulate and our data was stored in a\ndatabase which was hosted on a server. If we hosted this database ourselves we were responsible for keeping it going and\nmaintaining it and all of its stored data. Our database could hold only a certain amount of data which meant that if we\nwere lucky enough to get a lot of traffic it would soon struggle to handle all of the requests coming its way and so our\nend users might experience some downtime or no data at all.</p><p>If we paid for a hosted server then we were paying for the up time even when no requests were being sent.</p><p>To counter these issues serverless computing was introduced. Now, lets cut through all the magic this might imply and\nsimply state that serverless still involves servers, the big difference is that they are hosted in the cloud and execute\nsome code for us.</p><p>Providing the requested resources as a simple function they only run when that request is made. This means that we are\nonly charged for the resources and time the code is running for. With this approach we have done away with the need to\npay a server provider for constant up time, which is one of the big plus points of going serverless.</p><p>Being able to scale up and down is also a major benefit of using serverless functions to interact with our data stores.\nIn a nutshell this means that as multiple requests come in via our serverless functions, our cloud provider can create\nmultiple instances of the same function to handle those requests and run them in parallel. One downside to this is the\nconcept of cold starts where because our functions are spun up on demand they need a small amount of time to start up\nwhich can delay our response. However, once up if multiple requests are received our serverless functions will stay open\nto requests and handle them before closing down again.</p><style data-emotion-css=\"15salui\">.css-15salui{font-size:1xl;font-family:heading;margin-top:3px;margin-bottom:3px;}</style><p class=\"chakra-text css-15salui\">FaunaDB</p><p>FaunaDB is a global serverless database that has native graphql support, is multi tenancy which allows us to have nested\ndatabases and is low latency from any location. Its also one of the only serverless databases to follow the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID\">ACID transactions</a> which guarantee consistent reads and writes to the database.</p><p>Fauna also provides us with a High Availability solution with each server globally located containing a partition of our\ndatabase, replicating our data asynchronously with each request with a copy of our database or the transaction made.</p><p>Some of the benefits to using Fauna can be summarized as:</p><style data-emotion-css=\"2yqebn\">.css-2yqebn{list-style-type:bullet;margin-left:1em;margin-top:2px;margin-bottom:2px;}</style><ul role=\"list\" class=\"css-2yqebn\"><li class=\"css-0\">Transactional</li><li class=\"css-0\">Multi-document</li><li class=\"css-0\">Geo-distributed</li></ul><p>In short, Fauna frees the developer from worry about single or multi-document solutions. Guarantees consistent data\nwithout burdening the developer on how to model their system to avoid consistency issues. To get a good overview of how\nFauna does this see this <a href=\"https://fauna.com/blog/consistency-without-clocks-faunadb-transaction-protocol\">blog post</a>\nabout the FaunaDB distributed transaction protocol.</p><p>There are a few other alternatives that one could choose instead of using Fauna such as:</p><style data-emotion-css=\"2yqebn\">.css-2yqebn{list-style-type:bullet;margin-left:1em;margin-top:2px;margin-bottom:2px;}</style><ul role=\"list\" class=\"css-2yqebn\"><li class=\"css-0\">Firebase</li><li class=\"css-0\">Cassandra</li><li class=\"css-0\">MongoDB</li></ul><p>But these options don&#x27;t give us the ACID guarantees that Fauna does, compromising scaling.</p><style data-emotion-css=\"15salui\">.css-15salui{font-size:1xl;font-family:heading;margin-top:3px;margin-bottom:3px;}</style><p class=\"chakra-text css-15salui\">ACID</p><style data-emotion-css=\"2yqebn\">.css-2yqebn{list-style-type:bullet;margin-left:1em;margin-top:2px;margin-bottom:2px;}</style><ul role=\"list\" class=\"css-2yqebn\"><li class=\"css-0\"><strong>Atomic</strong> - all transactions are a single unit of truth, either they all pass or none.

into the data from the Potter API. Our top\nlevel query will return two things, an array of Characters and an array of Spells. We have then defined our Character\nand Spell types. We don&#x27;t need to specify an id here as when we seed the data from the Potter API we will attach it\nthen.</p><p>Now that we have our schema we can import it into Fauna. Head to your fauna console and navigate to the graphql tab on\nthe left, click import schema and find the file we just created, click import and prepare to be amazed!</p><p>Once the import is complete we will be presented with a graphql playground where we can run queries against our newly\ncreated database using its schema. Alas, we have yet to add any data, but you can check the collections and indexes tabs\non the left of the console and see that fauna has created two new collections for us, Character and Spell.</p><p>A collection is a grouping of our data with each piece of data being a document. Or a table with rows if you are coming\nfrom an SQL background. Click the indexes tab to see our two new query indexes that we specified in our schema,\nallCharacters and allSpells. db-connection.js</p><p>Inside db-connection.js we will create the Fauna client connection, we will use this connection to seed data into our\ndatabase.</p><pre><pre class=\"prism-code language-js\"

key from our Fauna database, if none is\nfound we are returning a helpful error message to the console. If the key is found we are creating a connection to our\nFauna database and exporting that connection from file. We are also exporting the query variable from Fauna as that will\nallow us to use some <a href=\"https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/api/fql/\">FQL</a> (Fauna Query Language) when seeding our data.</p><p>Head over to your Fauna console and click the security tab, click new key and select admin from the role dropdown. The\nadmin role will allow us to manage the database, in our case, seed data into it. Choose the name FAUNA_ADMIN and hit\nsave. We will need to create another key for use in using our stored schema from Fauna. Select server for the role of\nthis key and name it SERVER_KEY. Don&#x27;t forget to make a note of the keys before you close the windows as you wont be\nable to view them again!</p><p>That’s a great start. Next up we will seed our data and begin implementing our frontend!</p><p>Now that we have our keys its time to grab one more, from the <a href=\"https://www.potterapi.com/\">Potter API</a>, it&#x27;s as simple\nas hitting the get key button in the top right hand corner of the page, make a note of it and head back to your code\neditor.</p><p>We don&#x27;t want our keys getting into the wrong wizards hands so lets store them as environment variables. Create a .env\nfile at the projects root and add add them.

We will be using some handy hooks from\nApollo for querying our (namely <a href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/queries/\">useQuery</a>) and for that to work\nwe must first set up our provider, which is similar to Reacts context provider. We will wrap our sites root with this\nprovider and pass in our client, thus making it available throughout our site. To wrap the root element in a Gatsby site\nwe must use the gatsby-browser.js and gatsby-ssr.js files. The implementation will be identical in both.</p><p><strong>gatsby-browser.js &amp;&amp; gatsby-ssr.js</strong></p><p>We will have to add a few more packages at this point:</p><pre><pre

ApolloClient instance and passed in the\nNetlify functions url as a http link then passed that down to the provider but i was encountering authorization issues,\nwith a helpful message stating that the request lacked authorization headers. The solution was to send the authorization\nalong with a header on every http request.</p><p>Lets take a look at what we have here:</p><style data-emotion-css=\"2yqebn\">.css-2yqebn{list-style-type:bullet;margin-left:1em;margin-top:2px;margin-bottom:2px;}</style><ul role=\"list\" class=\"css-2yqebn\"><li class=\"css-0\">Created a new http link much the same as we did before when creating our server instance.</li><li class=\"css-0\">Create an auth link which returns the headers to the context so the http link can read them. Here we pass in our Fauna\nkey with server rights.</li><li class=\"css-0\">Then we create the client to be passed to the provider with the link now set as the auth link.</li></ul><p>Now that we have the nuts and bolts all setup we can move onto some frontend code!</p><style data-emotion-css=\"15salui\">.css-15salui{font-size:1xl;font-family:heading;margin-top:3px;margin-bottom:3px;}</style><p class=\"chakra-text css-15salui\">Make it work then make it pretty!</p><p>We&#x27;ll also want to create some base components.

used the jsx pragma from theme-ui to allow to to style our elements and components inline with\nthe object syntax</li><li class=\"css-0\">The HarryPotterLogo is a logo i found via google which was placed in a folder named assets inside of our src folder.\nIts an svg which we alter the height and width of using the sx prop.</li><li class=\"css-0\">Gatsby link is needed for us to navigate between pages in our site.</li></ul><p>You may be wondering why we have installed emotion/styled when we could just use the sx prop, like we have done else\nwhere... Well the answer lies in the affect we are using on the page links.</p><p>The sx prop doesn’t seem to have access to, or i should say perhaps that its doesn&#x27;t have in its definitions, the\n-webkit-background-clip property which we are using to add a cool linear-gradient affect on hover. For this reason we\nhave pulled the logic our into a new component called PageLink which is a styled Gatsby Link. With styled components we\ncan use regular css syntax and as such have access to the -webkit-background-clip property.</p><p>The header component is taking the location prop provided by @reach/router which Gatsby uses under the hood for its\nrouting. This is used to determine which page we are on. Due to the fact that we have a different layout for our main\nhome page and the rest of the site we simply use the location object to check if we are on the home page, if we are we\nset a display none to hide the header component.</p><p>The last thing we need to do is set our grid areas which we will be using in later pages. This is just my preferred way\nof doing it, but i like the separation. Create a new folder inside of src called window and add an index.js file.</p><pre><pre class=\"prism-code language-js\"

To recap how this works we can take a closer\nlook at the gridTemplateAreas property and see that the first index is for phone (or mobile if you will) with the second\nbeing tablet and the third desktop.

pages and the projects repository. You can\nchange the text I’ve added, this was just for demo purposes. As you can see, we are again using emotion/styled as we are\nmaking use of the -webkit-background-clip property on our cool linear-gradient links. We have two here, one for external\nlinks, which uses the a tag, and another for internal link which uses Gatsby Link. Note that you should always use the\ntraditional HTML a tag for external links and the Gatsby Link to configure your internal routing.</p><p>You may also notice that there is an import from a helper file what exports some emojis. Lets take a look at that.\nCreate a new folder inside of src.</p><pre><pre class=\"prism-code language-bash\"

href=\"https://beautifuldingbats.com/emoji-clipboard/\">Emoji Clipboard</a>,\nit lets you search and literally copy paste the emojis! We’ll be using these emojis in our cards to display the\ncharacters from Harry Potter. As well as the emojis we have some utility functions that will also be used in the cards.\nEach house in Harry Potter has a set of colors that sets them apart form the other houses. These we have exported as\nlinear-gradients for later use.</p><p>Nice! We are nearly there but we haven’t quite finished yet! Next we will use our data and display it to the user of our\nsite!</p><p>We have done quite a bit of setup but haven’t yet had a chance to use our data that we have saved in our Fauna database.\nNow’s the time to bring in Apollo and put together a page that shows all the characters data for each house. We are also\ngoing to implement a simple searchbar to allow the user to search the characters of each house!</p><p>Inside src/pages create a new file called houses.js and add the following:</p><p><strong>houses.js</strong></p><pre><pre class=\"prism-code language-jsx\"

There after we use the useEffect hook to set the initial house as Gryffindor (because Gryffindor\nis best. Fight me!) The dependency array takes in the loading and data states.</p><p>We then have a function which returns a switch statement (I know not everyone likes these but i do and i find that they\nare simple to read and understand). This function checks the currently selected house and if there are no errors in the\nquery it loads the data from that house into the selected house state array. This function is passed down to another\ncomponent which uses that data to display the house characters in a grid of cards.</p><p>Lets create that component now.

It has an internal state which holds an emptyQuery variable\nwhich we set to empty string and a filteredData array, set to empty. The function that runs in our searchbar is the\nfollowing function declared in the hook. It takes the query as an event from the input, checks if the data provided to\nthe hook has data or sets it to an empty array as a new variable called members. It then filters over the members array\nand checks if the query matches one of the characters names. Finally it sets the state with the returned filtered data\nand query.</p><p>We structure the state and create a new variable which checks if the state had any data or not. Finally returning the\ndata, be that empty or not and the search function.</p><p>Phew! That was a lot to go over. Going back to our main section we can see that we are importing our new hook and\npassing in the selected house data, then destructing the members and search query function. The component checks if the\nhouse array has any length, if it does it returns the page. The page displays the current house, how many members the\nhouse has, the searchbar (which takes the search query function as a prop), a new house section which we will build and\nmaps over the

Hogwarts, let them select a house and pass that\nselection back up to the main-section state. The component takes the getHouse function from main-section as a prop. We\nhave created an internal link styled component , which takes each houses colours from our helper file, and returns the\nselected house on click.</p><p>Using framer motion we prepend each li with the motion tag. This allows us to add a simple scale animation by setting\nthe initial value 0 (so it’s not visible), using the animate prop we say that it should animate in to it’s set size. The\ntransition is specifying how the animation will work.</p><p>Back to the main-section component, we map over each member in the house and display their data in a Card component by\nspreading all the character data.

file. The container and item objects are for\nuse in our animations from framer motion. We descructure our props, of which there are many, and return a div which has\nthe framer motion object prepended to it and the item object passed to the variants prop. This is a simpler way of\npassing the object and all of it’s values through. For certain properties we run a null check against them to\ndeterminate what we should show.</p><p>The only thing left to do is implement the Spells page and its associated components then the implementation of this\nsite is done!
