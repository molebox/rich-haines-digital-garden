Well we are basically saying redwood (rw) can you generate (g) a page called home at route (/) which as we all know, because we are all professionals here, the root route.</p><p>RedwoodJS will now generate two new files, one called HomePage (RedwoodJS prefixes the name we give in the command with page, because its nice like that) and a test file. Which passes! Of course this is just a render test and if we add more logic we should add tests for it in this file.</p><p>We can leave the home page for a second and run some more RedwoodJS CLI commands because they are amazing and give us lots of stuff for free!

You&#x27;ll want to go to domains &amp; urls first and add localhost:8910 to the domain filed and hit save. This will tell snipcart to look for this domain in dev. Keep the protocal as http as thats what RedwoodJS uses for local dev. Next scroll down to api keys and copy the first line of the code they say to copy. For example:</p><pre><pre class=\"prism-code language-html\" style=\"color:#9CDCFE;background-color:#1E1E1E;overflow:scroll;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:20px;padding:16px;display:flex;flex-direction:column;width:100%;position:relative\"><div class=\"token-line\" style=\"color:#9CDCFE\"><span class=\"token tag punctuation\" style=\"color:rgb(212, 212, 212)\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token tag\" style=\"color:rgb(78, 201, 176)\">link</span><span class=\"token tag\" style=\"color:rgb(78, 201, 176)\"></span></div><div class=\"token-line\" style=\"color:#9CDCFE\"><span class=\"token tag\" style=\"color:rgb(78, 201, 176)\">  </span><span class=\"token tag attr-name\" style=\"color:rgb(156, 220, 254)\">rel</span><span class=\"token tag attr-value punctuation\" style=\"color:rgb(212, 212, 212)\">=</span><span class=\"token tag attr-value punctuation\" style=\"color:rgb(212, 212, 212)\">&quot;</span><span class=\"token tag attr-value\" style=\"color:rgb(206, 145, 120)\">stylesheet</span><span class=\"token tag attr-value punctuation\" style=\"color:rgb(212, 212, 212)\">&quot;</span><span class=\"token tag\" style=\"color:rgb(78, 201, 176)\"></span></div><div class=\"token-line\" style=\"color:#9CDCFE\"><span class=\"token tag\" style=\"color:rgb(78, 201, 176)\">  </span><span class=\"token tag attr-name\" style=\"color:rgb(156, 220, 254)\">href</span><span class=\"token tag attr-value punctuation\" style=\"color:rgb(212, 212, 212)\">=</span><span class=\"token tag attr-value punctuation\" style=\"color:rgb(212, 212, 212)\">&quot;</span><span class=\"token tag attr-value\" style=\"color:rgb(206, 145, 120)\">https://cdn.snipcart.com/themes/v3.0.10/default/snipcart.css</span><span class=\"token tag attr-value punctuation\" style=\"color:rgb(212, 212, 212)\">&quot;</span><span class=\"token tag\" style=\"color:rgb(78, 201, 176)\"></span></div><div class=\"token-line\" style=\"color:#9CDCFE\"><span class=\"token tag\" style=\"color:rgb(78, 201, 176)\"></span><span class=\"token tag punctuation\" style=\"color:rgb(212, 212, 212)\">/&gt;</span></div><style data-emotion-css=\"13tafan\">.css-13tafan{display:-webkit-inline-box;display:-webkit-inline-flex;display:-ms-inline-flexbox;display:inline-flex;-webkit-appearance:none;-moz-appearance:none;appearance:none;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;-webkit-box-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;justify-content:center;-webkit-transition:all 250ms;transition:all 250ms;-webkit-user-select:none;-moz-user-select:none;-ms-user-select:none;user-select:none;white-space:nowrap;vertical-align:middle;outline:none;width:auto;justify-self:flex-end;position:absolute;top:0;right:20px;color:brand.crayola.300;margin-top:4px;text-transform:uppercase;font-weight:600;}</style><button type=\"button\" class=\"chakra-button css-13tafan\" aria-label=\"Copy text\" role=\"button\">Grab It</button></pre></pre><p>Open the index.html file at the web projects root and past the style sheet into the head element. next copy the div ans script tags and paste them inside the body tag but below the div with id of redwood-app. It should look like this except your api key will be different.</p><p>You can use this api key and keep it in your html file which will be committed\nto git because, and i quote &quot;The public API key is the key you need to add on\nyour website when including the snipcart.js file.

product url. When in dev you van use localhost:8910. The reason i left this in the example is to try and remind you that you will have to change this when deploying otherwise snipcart wont recognize the products url. On that note lets commit and push our changes.</p><p>Our site is ready to go live. We have setup a simple ecommerce website with minimal effort. Of course there is much more we can do, and will do! I wont cover deployment in this tutorial, you can check the awesome <a href=\"https://redwoodjs.com/tutorial/deployment\">docs</a>. In the next tutorial we will add <a href=\"https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/identity/\">Netlify Identity</a> with a protected route so that our admins can add and edit products from within the website. I hope you enjoyed this, let me know what you think on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/studio_hungry\">twitter</a>! 😊</p>","scope":{"title":"Redwood ecommerce with Snipcart","published":true,"category":"Tutorial","author":"Richard Haines","tags":["redwoodjs","ecommerce"],"pin":false,"description":"A tutorial to create an ecommerce site with redwood and snipcart","growth":"full"}},"frontMatter":{"title":"Redwood ecommerce with Snipcart","published":true,"category":"Tutorial","author":"Richard Haines","tags":["redwoodjs","ecommerce"],"pin":false,"description":"A tutorial to create an ecommerce site with redwood and snipcart","growth":"full"},"slug":["redwood-ecommerce-with-snipcart"]},"__N_SSG":true}
