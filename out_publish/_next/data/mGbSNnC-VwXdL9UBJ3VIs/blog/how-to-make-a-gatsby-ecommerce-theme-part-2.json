you can see the type the field expects with the type key. For some they refer to other objects which themselves define their own input fields. For example the Default variant object field. For more information of the inner workings of sanity i highly suggest you go over their docs. They are really exceptional. For now we can leave this file as is.</p><p>After you have had a little explore of the different schema files and read the docs on the sanity site create a new file in the schemas folder and call it home.js. We will use this to allow the theme user to add a hero image to the home page of our theme.

If we make a change to our schema we have to remember to run sanity graphql deploy for the changes to take affect. You should now be able to view the studio at gatsby-theme-fashion.sanity.studio. On the left of the studio you will see all of our content, the stuff created from the schema definitions. Click on the product and then click to create a new product. Now you should be able to see how each of the field type are represented in the studio. The default variant box is where we will be getting most of our data from. Feel free add some products, filling in the necessary information. As we chose the ecommerce template there will already be some products you can use for reference. I would suggest looking over them and adding your own. Once done remove the default template products.</p><p>Open the home content tab on the left and add an image to be displayed on the home page of our theme. Make sure you remember to hit publish every time you add or change something in the studio otherwise nothing will happen 😆. If you open the blog content tab and scroll down you will see what looks like a wysiwyg editor. This is sanities rich text editor. In order to properly display its contents in our theme we will need to install another package.</p><pre><pre class=\"prism-code language-bash\" style=\"color:#9CDCFE;background-color:#1E1E1E;overflow:scroll;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:20px;padding:16px;display:flex;flex-direction:column;width:100%;position:relative\"><div class=\"token-line\" style=\"color:#9CDCFE\"><span class=\"token function\" style=\"color:rgb(220, 220, 170)\">yarn</span><span class=\"token plain\"> </span><span class=\"token function\" style=\"color:rgb(220, 220, 170)\">add</span><span class=\"token plain\"> @sanity/block-content-to-react</span></div><style data-emotion-css=\"13tafan\">.css-13tafan{display:-webkit-inline-box;display:-webkit-inline-flex;display:-ms-inline-flexbox;display:inline-flex;-webkit-appearance:none;-moz-appearance:none;appearance:none;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;-webkit-box-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;justify-content:center;-webkit-transition:all 250ms;transition:all 250ms;-webkit-user-select:none;-moz-user-select:none;-ms-user-select:none;user-select:none;white-space:nowrap;vertical-align:middle;outline:none;width:auto;justify-self:flex-end;position:absolute;top:0;right:20px;color:brand.crayola.300;margin-top:4px;text-transform:uppercase;font-weight:600;}</style><button type=\"button\" class=\"chakra-button css-13tafan\" aria-label=\"Copy text\" role=\"button\">Grab It</button></pre></pre><p>This will render an array of block text from the rich text editor in our studio. Each paragraph will be an index in the array. Now in order to use this component and display our rich text properly we will have to create some serializers. This concept was hard for me to understand at first and i did do some hacky stuff to get it working. The actual way of doing it, once you get it right is very simple. There is a handy blog post about it by Eric Howey - <a href=\"https://www.erichowey.dev/writing/using-theme-ui-with-sanity/\">using-theme-ui-with-sanity</a>\nthat gives an example of using the serializers with theme-ui, we&#x27;ll be using the sx prop directly instead of importing the theme-ui Styled component but it will work much the same way. Lets create a folder under components and name it common. Inside create a file called index.js and add the following:</p><style data-emotion-css=\"qh131u\">.css-qh131u{font-size:xl;font-family:heading;margin-top:3px;margin-bottom:3px;}</style><p

Its important to always keep your API keys and other sensitive information hidden so the go to thing to do is use env variables.</p><p>Now that we have configured our theme to use our sanity backend we can start creating some components to fetch the data and display it. We&#x27;ll start with the home page. As of now all we have to display is our hero image we added to our home content in the studio. Create a folder under components and call it home.
