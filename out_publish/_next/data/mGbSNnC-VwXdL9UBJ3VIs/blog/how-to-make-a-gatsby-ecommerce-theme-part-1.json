There are of course a lot more thing we could add but lets keep it simple for our example theme. We will be keeping our layout fairly simple with a navbar at the top followed by a hero image and a section explaining about the store. Then a showcase of our top 3 most popular products followed by our Instagram feed and finishing off with our contact form in our footer.</p><p>We can begin by creating all the necessary pages:</p><pre><pre class=\"prism-code language-bash\" style=\"color:#9CDCFE;background-color:#1E1E1E;overflow:scroll;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:20px;padding:16px;display:flex;flex-direction:column;width:100%;position:relative\"><div class=\"token-line\" style=\"color:#9CDCFE\"><span class=\"token builtin class-name\" style=\"color:rgb(78, 201, 176)\">cd</span><span class=\"token plain\"> packages/gatsby-theme-fashion/src/pages</span></div><div class=\"token-line\" style=\"color:#9CDCFE\"><span class=\"token plain\"></span><span class=\"token function\" style=\"color:rgb(220, 220, 170)\">touch</span><span class=\"token plain\"> products.js</span></div><div class=\"token-line\" style=\"color:#9CDCFE\"><span class=\"token plain\"></span><span class=\"token function\" style=\"color:rgb(220, 220, 170)\">touch</span><span class=\"token plain\"> blog.js</span></div><style data-emotion-css=\"13tafan\">.css-13tafan{display:-webkit-inline-box;display:-webkit-inline-flex;display:-ms-inline-flexbox;display:inline-flex;-webkit-appearance:none;-moz-appearance:none;appearance:none;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;-webkit-box-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;justify-content:center;-webkit-transition:all 250ms;transition:all 250ms;-webkit-user-select:none;-moz-user-select:none;-ms-user-select:none;user-select:none;white-space:nowrap;vertical-align:middle;outline:none;width:auto;justify-self:flex-end;position:absolute;top:0;right:20px;color:brand.crayola.300;margin-top:4px;text-transform:uppercase;font-weight:600;}</style><button type=\"button\" class=\"chakra-button css-13tafan\" aria-label=\"Copy text\" role=\"button\">Grab It</button></pre></pre><p>Theme-ui will enable our end user to override some of our style with ease through shadowing our theme file which will hold all of our colours, fonts and spacings. In order to get started with adding our themeable variables we need to shadow the index.js file form the gatsby-plugin-theme-ui package in our src folder. See <a href=\"https://theme-ui.com/\">Theme-ui</a> for more details.</p><p>I often start with the sites basic layout. There are a couple of ways to do this. We could create a layout component in our components folder with a css reset and import that into all or our components/pages but there is an easier way utilizing gatsby-plugin-layout.</p><p>Lets add

I used to use Emotion css plus theme-ui to design and style my components, you can read about my experience here <a href=\"&#x27;./css-grid-with-theme-ui.mdx&#x27;\">CSS grid with Theme-ui</a>. Basically theme-ui allows us to specify breakpoints using an array syntax, so <!-- -->[mobile, tablet, desktop]<!-- -->. Pretty cool huh! Now we need to create our nav, main and footer components. All the sites amin content will live inside the main component, by using gatsby-plugin-layout we can just import main as a wrapper to tell gatsby that whatever component should be rendered inside this grid area.</p><p>Create a layout folder inside our components folder and add these three components:</p><style

When using theme-ui we import all of our styles from one main index file. This file can be shadowed by the theme consumer and thus they can override whatever styles we have in there to change the look of the theme. Lets create that now.</p><p>Inside the src folder create a new folder called gatsby-plugin-theme-ui, inside that folder create a new file named index.js and add the following:</p><style
