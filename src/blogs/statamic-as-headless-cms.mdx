description: How to use Statamic as a headless CMS hooked up to Gatsby

Statamic v3 is many things. It's a Content Management Studio (CMS) where data can be pulled via an API endpoint. It's a Static Site Generator (SSG) which can be deployed to any Content Delivery Network (CDN) known to man. It's a content creation tool, enabling content creators to write posts and store and distribute videos. It's an open source PHP based Laravel package that is designed to scale and be used as both a front and backend.

Phew, that was a lot of joy to be throwing Statamics way. You may be thinking there is a but coming...... You'd be wrong. As a first time user I found the experience of both setting it up and grabbing data rather painless. Of course, I stumbled a few times and we will go over those together so that you don't have to do it alone. But all in all I'd have to say that I'm mightily impressed! Also the site and docs are just super cool to look at reading the copy feels like you're chatting with a mate.

With the release of v3, Statamic introduced a formal way of grabbing the data stored, the content API. In v2 there was the possibility to create an addon which would supply JSON endpoints but with the introduction of the content API, getting your dirty little hands on that lovely data has become a first class citizen. Its now fully supported with a read-only endpoint. This feature at the time of writing is a PRO only feature, though we can still use it and try it out on a trial basis until we decide to purchase a license.

So what are we going to build? We're going to be using Statamic as a headless CMS. We'll create a new Statamic project from scratch as well as a new Gatsby project from scratch and join the two, as one, like some super Jamstack baby from the future.

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of React and JavaScript
- Basic knowledge of the command line
- Positivity! Ain't nothing getting done on a downer, let's have some fun!
- Snacks

Cool beans, let's get started!

## Installing Statamic

I'm one of those devs that use a windows machine, I'm not going to apologise, but what I will do it front up some handy info for the other rebels out there who dare operate outside the cool-belt. For Mac users I send you to [laravel homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/homestead) to get your basic setup going.

Now, assuming we are coming at this from having no PHP installed on our machines I point you towards [laragon](https://laragon.org/) which will cover local apache server, PHP and other goodies installations. Follow the instructions by downloading the installer and hitting yes/next until it's done.

Once you have laragon installed open it up by double clicking the big blue elephant that has taken up residense on your desktop. In the bottom right corner there is a button called Root, hit that. The file explorer will open inside the www folder, it's in here that we will install our Statamic project. But before we do we have to make sure that we have composer installed. For the uninitiated, composer is is the NPM to the PHP world, so a package manager. Head on over to [getcomposer.org/](https://getcomposer.org/) and follow the installation guide.

Now that we have our pieces in place we can install Statamic. Open your terminal inside the www folder inside laragon and run:

```bash
composer create-project statamic/statamic statamic-gatsby --prefer-dist --stability=dev
```

I chose to name the project statamic-gatsby but you can rename this to whatever you like. The reason we created our project in this folder is that laragon creates a virtual host for us and maps the folder name in www to a url appended with .test. In the laragon GUI click the settings cog in the top right and you will see in the General tab the Document root. This is the place that will map the project folder names to the url. If you wish to change this then do so and create your new project in your new folders path. I personally had issues with Apache running on port 80 so changed it to 81, just a heads up, this may not affect you and your installation.

Open the new Statamic project in your fav code editor (I'll be using VSCode) and install all the dependencies.

```bash
composer install
```

It's likely that you will be hit with an out of memory warning. You can first try running the following:

```bash
COMPOSER_MEMORY_LIMIT=2G composer install
```

This attempts to set the memory limit to 2GB, though I have to confess that this particular approach didn't work for me. Instead I had to manually set the new memory limit in the php.ini file. To do so go back to the laragon GUI and click the Menu button, PHP then php.ini. On line 401 change the memory allocation. I just whacked it up to 6GB (memory_limit = 6G) but this of course depends on your setup and what you can afford to spare. Anything above 3 and you should be super safe.

Run composer install again and a vender folder should have been crated at the statamic projects root. Now we are cooking!! Next we will want to open the .env file at the project root and alter/add a few values.

```.env
// At the top
APP_URL=http://statamic-gatsby.test:81/

// Towards the bottom
STATAMIC_API_ENABLED=true
STATAMIC_API_ROUTE=api
```

Add the new sites url as the APP_URL, if you changed the port from 80 then append this otherwise you may encounter a 404 page and be scratching your head for a few hours (you're welcome, and my head hurts). The bottom two additions are telling Statamic that we want to use the new content API and setting the url endpoint to api. Now open config/statamic/api.php and change the following:

```php
// From
'enabled' => env('STATAMIC_API_ENABLED', false),
// To
'enabled' => env('STATAMIC_API_ENABLED', true),
```

Now you can open config/statamic/editions.php and change the license to pro, like so:

```php
'pro' => true,
```

This will enble us to use the content API feature.

## Create a new Gatsby project

I love Gatsby. I especially love creating fresh, brand spanking new Gatsby sites. So let's do just that. Create a new project folder at your location of choice and enter the following from the command line:

```bash
yarn init -y
yarn add react react-dom gatsby @chakra-ui/core gatsby-source-statamic
yarn add prettier -D
```

That will give you a project folder with a package.json and node_modules and not much else. Create a src/pages folder with an index.js inside the pages folder. Then add the following to your package.json, above the dependencies always seems right to me.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "gatsby develop",
    "build": "gatsby build",
    "clean": "gatsby clean",
    "pretty": "prettier --write \"src/**/*js\"",
    "z": "gatsby clean && gatsby develop"
  },
```

All pretty standard stuff

- dev will spin up a development server
- build will make it ready for the outside world
- clean will tuck in its shirt and re-do its hair
- pretty will apply makeup and tighten its belt
- z will start it all over again from scratch. A clean plate if you will.

We are going to take advantage of a handy package called gatsby-source-statamic. This is basically a wrapper around a fetch request to our API endpoint that takes care of sorting out all our collections and assets. We have installed Chakra so that we can add some quick styling to our site. This tutorial won't be a deep dive into styling and will keep things pretty basic, Chakra will at least make the experience a little more pleasant on the eye. Finally we have added prettier as a dev dependency. No funny business, just for our piece of mind when we get those tabs in the wrong place and our spacing all mucked up from copying code from one file to another.

Before we can enter our Statamic project we will need to create a new super user to login with. From the command line run the following (amazingly intuitive) code then follow the on terminal prompts.

```bash
php please make:user
```

## The Statamic GUI

To start our Statamic project open the laragon GUI and in the bottom left hit the Start All button. This will spin up an Apache server running our project. Then navigate to the url that is our project name with .test and possibly the port number. In my case it was http://statamic-gatsby.test:81 This will bring up a login page, login with the super user details you just created then once logged into the home page, click the control panel. It's time to create our first blog post, but before we do let's quickly go over some of the stuff we can do.

On the left of the page you will see a menu with content, fields, tools and users
