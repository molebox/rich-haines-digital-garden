I recently received [Colby Fayocks](https://twitter.com/colbyfayock) [50reactprojects](https://50reactprojects.com/) and thought it would be a fun idea to run through some of the example projects as tutorials, while putting a little spin on them. So we begin with project 1 of the 50 (well, why not!), the marketing website. Colby does a great job of listing out the requirements of the project and some of the tech you could use to get it made.

This tutorial will assume some prior knowledge of the following:

- JavaScript
- React

## The brief

The marketing team for the company you work for just launched a new product. They need a detailed marketing plan that includes a website and landing page dedicated to driving people to learn about the product and ultimately purchase it.

Well that sounds clear and concise. We are to create a landing page and website that will entice the user to purchase the product. For our example we'll skip the website creation and concentrate on creating a killer landing page. For our stack we will keep it modern and use [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). We will style our site with the wonderful [Chakra-UI](https://next.chakra-ui.com/docs/getting-started).

This first section will outline how to install everything you need.

## Install the stuff

We'll use [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) to bootstrap our project and get the basics installed. Run the following command and input the projects name. I'll choose next-mdx-landing-page, because Im feeling super imaginative but feel free to go wild and name it anything you like

```bash
yarn create next-app
```

Next we are going to install two more packages to handle MDX.

```bash
yarn add @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader
```

Once they have been installed open the project in your editor of choice, Im using VSCode. You'll see that an api folder was installed along with an example serverless function. We will not be using that so you can go ahead and delete the whole api folder. In fact, you can also remove the styles folder and all of its content, the index.js file under the pages folder and the favicon.ico and vercel.svg inside of the public folder.

So to recap, remove the following from the project:

- api folder and contents
- styles folder and contents
- index.js file inside pages folder
- favicon and vercel images inside public

## Enabling MDX

We'll keep the public folder incase we want to store some images later on. Now our app is going to need just one page, a landing page. That page is going to be an MDX file. So go ahead and create a new index.mdx inside the pages folder. Then open up \_app.js, this is the root of our site, it's form here that we will wrap the app and provide our mdx file its components. For now lets wrap the base component with the MDXProvider.

```jsx
import { MDXProvider } from '@mdx-js/react';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <MDXProvider>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </MDXProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

There is no need to import React as it's globally available to us. Open up the index.mdx file and write the traditional "MDX is amazing". Now for Next to be able to pick up our mdx file located in the pages directory we will have to configure it to do so. At the projects root create a new file called next.config.js. In here we will require mdx and set the page extensions to look for mdx files in the pages directory.

```js
const withMDX = require('@next/mdx')({
  extension: /\.mdx?$/,
});
module.exports = withMDX({
  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'md', 'mdx'],
});
```

Now we can run `yarn dev`, Next will spin up a dev server for us on port 3000, and if everything went well we should see the contents of our index.mdx file - MDX is amazing!

## Get some styling in there

Cool beans, our project works and our app loads an mdx file. But it's nothing to look at at the moment. Let's add Chakra-UI. We'll be using v1.0 so be sure to consult the documentation for that version (which at the time of writing is the latest) if you run into any troubles with Chakra.

As a brief overview of the installation differences, < v1.0 you had to install

- @chakra-ui/core
- @emotion/core
- @emotion/core
- emotion-theming

This has now been consolidated down to one package, which is great. Run the following to install Chakra. The version that installs with this tutorial is 1.0.0-rc.3.

```bash
yarn add @chakra-ui/core@next
```

Once Chakra is installed wrap the app with the ChakraProvider just like the MDXProvider in \_app.js. This will enable us to later use the components we set to the markdown elements within our MDX file.

```jsx
import { MDXProvider } from '@mdx-js/react';
import { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/core';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ChakraProvider resetCSS>
      <MDXProvider>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </MDXProvider>
    </ChakraProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

Now that we have Chakra hooked up let's add a base theme. Out of the box Chakra comes with some great defaults for colors inspired by Tailwind CSS, but as a way of learning how to do it we can add our own colors. I like to explore [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) when trying to find inspiration for website color pallets. In the top right click explore and find a pallete that you like. Once you have decided on your pallet click the 3 dots and open in generator. Once there you can click view shades on each color and choose some different shades, getting lighter from the original color (so 4 steps upward until you have 5 shades including the original) These will come in handy when adding depth to elements.

Create a theme.js file at the projects root. (These are the exact color I use for this site!)

```js
// 1. Import the theme and merge util
import { theme as ChakraTheme } from '@chakra-ui/core';
import { merge } from '@chakra-ui/utils';

// 2. Extend the theme to include custom colors, fonts, etc.
export const theme = merge(ChakraTheme, {
  colors: {
    brand: {
      text: '#121212',
      capri: {
        100: '#00BBF9',
        200: '#00B8F5',
        300: '#00A8E0',
        400: '#0099CC',
        500: '#0080B8',
      },
      seaGreen: {
        100: '#00F5D4',
        200: '#00E0C2',
        300: '#00CCB1',
        400: '#00B89F',
        500: '#00A38D',
      },
      minionYellow: {
        100: '#FEE440',
        200: '#FEE334',
        300: '#FEE020',
        400: '#FEDD0B',
        500: '#F4D301',
      },
      crayola: {
        100: '#F15BB5',
        200: '#F056B3',
        300: '#EF43AA',
        400: '#ED31A2',
        500: '#EB1E99',
      },
      amethyst: {
        100: '#9B5DE5',
        200: '#9250E2',
        300: '#873EE0',
        400: '#7C2CDD',
        500: '#7222D3',
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Now that we have our base colors its time to reflect and think about the design..... (I'll let you into a little secret, that color pallet is this sites color pallet)

If we wanted to add some global styles such as a custom cursor....We could add it to the theme config like so:

```js
  styles: {
    global: {
      'html, body': {
        cursor: 'url(/absolute-path-to-funny-thing), auto',
      },
    },
  },
```

This is housed in the public folder. Next js serves static assets via the public folder. If you add an asset to the folder they become available just by adding a forward slash before the named source => src="/my-image.png" so in public/my-image.png.

Let's mate a layout. Like any good frontend developer we sound be about to come up with a layout or at the very least, follow what we are told.......
